# Tennis Class Scraper
----
## what is this?

This is a simple web scraper I built in 2017 using Python and Selenium to automatically check my tennis club's website for open classes because classes are often fully booked up for weeks on end. I schedule it to run automatically on my computer every night and it would text me a list of open classes using Twilio. Of course, since it ran on my own computer, it would often interrupt whatever I was doing.

Now I am looking to fix it back up and get it to work on the cloud using AWS Lambda.
